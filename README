  This  is  NSS-based DNS  filter  for  blacklisting site  names  with
regular expressions.  It can be set  up as system wide and/or personal
filter  for  improving your  security  and  resisting to  adversiting.
Remember that  while disabling some  internet names you  are disabling
some features of internet software.

  To set  system-wide filter  put `hosts.blacklist' file  into `/etc/'
folder.  To  set your personal  filter (recomended) put the  file into
your ~/.config folder. In later case  you can change the filter on the
fly (between internet queries).  Actual  filter is made of all regular
expressions from both system-wide and personal lists.

  Sample  hosts.blacklist file  appears in  `$prefix/share/nss-filter'
folder after installing where prefix is usually `/usr'.

  Note to  adversiting resisters:  It is not  enough to  just blocking
some (or most) internet names  to minimize adversiting.  Most internet
sites starts to  load CPU with cycle enumerating  (or even generating)
adversiting internet URIs.  Blocking  with template matching all these
URIs works with  a cost of wasting processor time.   So combining this
method with script blockers is better choice.

  Note  to all:  this  is rather  a GNU-Licensed  toy  then a  serious
defense tool. NO WARRANTY  IS GIVEN ON WHAT IS EVEN  WORKS.  USE IT AT
YOUR OWN RISK. And ... enjoy!  I will be happy if it helps you.
